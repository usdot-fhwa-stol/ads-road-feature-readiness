Roadway Categories,Definition,Attributes of Element(s) Key to ADS perception,,,,Key Scenarios ,Metric for Measuring Degree of Readiness,,,,,
,,Presence,Location,Design,Status,,,,,,,
Pavement Surfaces,One or more layers of a pavement structure designed to accommodate traffic load,"Yes, required for ADS operation",Within the right-of-way; edge of pavement,"Pavement type (Asphalt, concrete, stones, etc.); construction joints; lane width","Grooved, milled, cracking, potholes, maintenance treatments",All operations and navigational areas of concern,"Lane miles, pavement condition.",,,,,
Pavement Marking,Traffic control devices on pavement surface used to convey messages to roadway users,May benefit ADS perception,Within the right-of-way; between lanes and edge of lanes or pavement,Striping locations; skip length and spacing; contrast; edge line width; patterns ,"Deteriorated markings, retroreflectivity ratings, ghost markings ",All operations and navigational areas of concern,Retroreflectivity; placement; standards for gores; exits; lane drops,,,,,
Cross Section,"The cross sectional characteristics of a road segment, including its layout and structural features.","The presence of some cross section elements, while would mainly be to support ADS operation, may pose some level of risk and conflict for ADS-equipped vehicles.",Within the right of way; Throughout the roadway network; within the ADS-equipped vehicle’s line of sight.,"Lane Width Variations; Presence of Turning Lanes; Ramp Designs; Metering Systems; Acceleration and Deceleration Lanes, number and configuration of temporary elements.","Consistency in cross-section elements design and implementation, well-maintained metering systems, age of elements.",All operations and navigational areas of concern,"Total number of lane miles with specific cross section features frequency and types of turning lanes and ramps, extent of metering systems analysis of acceleration/deceleration lane layouts",,,,,
Signals,Signal where traffic is alternatively directed to stop and permitted to proceed,"Yes, required for ADS operation at points of conflict",Above or near roadways,Bulb type; refresh rate; signal phasing and timing,Functionality; condition,"Scenarios with potential vehicular or multi-modal conflict (intersections, merging, pedestrians, etc.)",Signal performance measures; detector failure; effective cycle length,,,,,
Signs,Control device that communicates roadway information or context,Color; size; shape; contrast; height; LED flicker rate,May be required for safe ADS operation at key scenarios,"Off roadways, near intersections, crossings or above roadways.",State of good repair; inventory,"All scenarios; Special scenarios including construction, road closure, and detours",Percent of signs in good repair; percent of signs in MUTCD compliance line sight,,,,,
Lighting Systems,"Lighting infrastructure that is specifically intended to illuminate roadways for automobiles, bicycles, and pedestrians.",Presence of a lighting system impacts roadway visibility and ADS perception during different times of day.,Location and uniformity of individual lights within a lighting system impact roadway visibility variation and ADS perception adaptation and sensitivity.,"Contrast, glare, perception-reaction time, and spectral effects impact ADS perception performance","lighting infrastructure that is specifically intended to illuminate roadways for automobiles, bicycles, and pedestrians.",All operations and navigational areas of concern particularly where visibility and ADS perception may be compromised due to times of day. This includes the safety critical scenario of pedestrian crossings.,Location and uniformity of individual lights within a lighting system impact roadway visibility variation and ADS perception adaptation and sensitivity.,,,,,
Structures,Bridges and culverts,Not applicable,"Over a depression or obstruction, water, highway, or railway","Height, width, asphalt; concrete;","Pavement surface, structural integrity (corrosion) ",TBD,"Potential metrics include lane widths, bridge condition, load restrictions, presence and location of breakdown or service lane.",,,,,
